# ASDS

# ASDS Algorithm (Agri Spray Decision System)

## Overview

The Agri Spray Decision System (ASDS) algorithm is a key component of the EVPA-Corn system, designed for precise pesticide delivery in row-planted corn cultivation. This algorithm works in conjunction with the GMA-YOLO visual model to generate accurate pesticide delivery sequences and match signals with target plants.

## Installation

To use the ASDS algorithm, you need to replace the existing files in the `ultralytics\yolo\engine` directory with the ASDS implementation. Follow these steps:

1. Download the ASDS algorithm files.
2. Navigate to your Ultralytics YOLO installation directory.
3. Locate the `ultralytics\yolo\engine` folder.
4. Replace the contents of this folder with the ASDS algorithm files.

## Usage

After replacing the files, you can use the ASDS algorithm as part of the YOLO framework
